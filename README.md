# Deutsche Bahn Train Delay Analysis

## Overview
This project was run in Sep 2024 as part of the final project at the WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Analytics Bootcamp.

This project analyzes train delays in Deutsche Bahnâ€™s local and regional services over a one-week period (08. Jul - 14. Jul). 
The analysis aims to identify patterns and causes of delays, provide actionable recommendations for improving punctuality, and present the findings in a concise 5-minute presentation to non-tech audience.

## Data
Initially, I planned to collect data using the Deutsche Bahn API. However, due to time constraints (I had only 1 week to complete the project) and difficulties with the API, I was unable to collect the data on my own. Instead, I used a dataset from Kaggle for the analysis. 

### Credits
This repository uses the dataset by Nokkyu, MNykth from Kaggle.

- **Dataset Title**: Deutsche Bahn (DB) delays
- **Author(s)**: Nokkyu, MNykth
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nokkyu/deutsche-bahn-db-delays

### Future Work
I plan to continue this project and will attempt to collect data using the Deutsche Bahn API in the future to provide more up-to-date and comprehensive insights.


## Languages and Libraries Used
- Python: Request, Pandas
- MySQL
- Tableau
- Google Slide


## Key Learning
- **Handling Large Datasets**: The dataset size was about 2 million records. I learned how to manage and process large datasets effectively.
- **Tools and Techniques**: I used Python and SQL for data exploration and analysis. This experience improved my skills in working with big data locally.
